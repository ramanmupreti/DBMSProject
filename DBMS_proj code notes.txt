DBMS_proj code notes

there is a system wide connector                                                                                          (no need of external connector) in putty

find /usr -name "mysql-connector-*.jar" 2>/dev/null                                                                       (to find connector .jar file)

javac fileName.java                                                                                                       (compile the java file)

java -cp ".:/usr/lib/java/mysql-connector-j-9.4.0.jar" fileName                                                           (run it with connector .jar file on classpath in putty)

java -cp ".;[connector .jar file path, no quotes, placed in same folder as .java file prgm]" EmployeeSearchFrame         (run it with connector .jar file on classpath locally)


Program workable
    - to adapt to different db server
         -make changes in database.properties file or equivalent .java file
                       db.baseUrl (of db server) (local / cloud instance link)
                       username (your)
                       passwd   (your)

database.properties (file with .properties extension)
db.baseUrl=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/  (local db server link)
db.user=username
db.password=passwd

LOCAL WORKFLOW
download and install mysql connector and put its .jar file in the same folder as the program folder
